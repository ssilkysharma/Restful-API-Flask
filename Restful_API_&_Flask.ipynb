        "Ans: RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. For example, to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet application. RESTful APIs support this information exchange because they follow secure, reliable, and efficient software communication standards.\n"

These functions are responsible for processing requests and returning the appropriate responses. Routing means mapping the URLs to a specific function that will handle the logic for that URL. Modern web frameworks use more meaningful URLs to help users remember the URLs and make navigation simpler.\n"

They enable you to define routes, views, templates, and static files in separate modules, which can then be registered with the main application. This modular approach enhances the maintainability, scalability, and reusability of your Flask\n",
        "Key Benefits of Flask Blueprints\n",
        "1.\tModular Organization\n",
        "Blueprints allow you to break your application into smaller, self-contained modules.

This modular structure makes your codebase more organized and easier to navigate.\n",

        "3.\tSeparation of Concerns\n",
        "Blueprints help keep different parts of your application logically separated. For example, the logic for handling user authentication can be encapsulated in an auth Blueprint, while the logic for managing blog posts can be in a blog Blueprint. This separation makes it easier to manage and scale your application.\n",

        "5.\tFlexible Routing\n",
        "Each Blueprint can have its own routing, which can be mounted on different paths within the main application. This allows for flexible and organized URL structures, especially useful when dealing with different versions of an API or distinct sections of your application.\n"
